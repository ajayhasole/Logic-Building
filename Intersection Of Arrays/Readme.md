Sure! Here's a simple README file with input and output descriptions for the `IntersectionOfArrays` Java program.

# Intersection of Two Arrays

## Description
This program finds the intersection of two integer arrays and returns an array of the unique elements that appear in both input arrays.

## Input
The program takes two integer arrays as input:
- `nums1`: The first integer array.
- `nums2`: The second integer array.

### Example Input
```java
int[] nums1 = {1, 2, 2, 1};
int[] nums2 = {2, 2};
```

## Output
The program returns an array containing the unique elements that are present in both `nums1` and `nums2`.

### Example Output
For the above input, the output will be:
```
2 
```

### Note
- The output array may contain fewer elements than the total number of occurrences of intersection elements, as duplicates are only included once.
