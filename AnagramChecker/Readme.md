# Anagram Checker

## Description
The Anagram Checker is a Java program that determines if two input strings are anagrams of each other. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another, using all the original letters exactly once. This program is case-insensitive and ignores spaces.

## Input
Two strings (e.g., `"listen"` and `"silent"`).

## Output
A boolean value:
- `true` if the strings are anagrams.
- `false` if they are not.

### Example
- Input: `"listen"` and `"silent"`
  - Output: `true`

- Input: `"hello"` and `"world"`
  - Output: `false`

- Input: `"Dormitory"` and `"Dirty room"`
  - Output: `true`
