# Maximum Subarray

## Description
The Maximum Subarray problem is a classic algorithmic challenge that aims to find the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers which has the largest sum. This implementation uses Kadane's Algorithm, which efficiently computes the maximum subarray sum in linear time.

## Input
- An array of integers, `nums`, which may contain both positive and negative numbers.

### Example Input
```plaintext
nums = [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]
