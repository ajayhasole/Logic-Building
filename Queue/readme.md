# Queue Implementation in Java

## Overview

This Java class implements a basic queue using an array. It provides fundamental queue operations including adding elements, removing elements, and displaying the current contents of the queue. It handles overflow and underflow conditions with appropriate messages.

## Input

The `Queue` class does not take user input directly. Instead, you can add elements programmatically using the `add(int e)` method and remove elements using the `remove()` method. 

In the provided `main` method:
- **Elements Added:** `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`
- **Display Method:** Shows all elements currently in the queue.
- **Remove Method:** Removes and prints elements from the front of the queue.

## Output

### Example Execution

After adding elements `1, 2, 3, 4, 5` and calling the `display()` method, the output will be:

```text
1
2
3
4
5
