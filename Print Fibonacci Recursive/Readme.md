# Fibonacci Sequence Generator

## Description
This Java program generates and prints the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms using a recursive method. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, typically starting with 0 and 1.

## Input
- The length of the Fibonacci sequence to generate (default is set to 10).

## Output
- A printed sequence of Fibonacci numbers up to the specified count. For example, with an input of 10, the output will be:
  ```
  A Fibonacci sequence of 10 numbers: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 
  ``` 

## Usage
1. Compile the Java program.
2. Run the program to see the Fibonacci sequence printed to the console. Adjust the `seqLength` variable in the `main` method to change the number of terms in the sequence.
